  // What do you noticed about how the computer printed out the variable y? Why do you think it did this?
  
  // Now, increase x by 1.
  // Note: do not just set x to 5. Instead write your code so that whatever x was, it is now 1 bigger.
  
  // println("x = " + x);
  
  // Next, create a variable called z that is the result of adding together x and y.
  // What type of variable will z have to be?
  
  // println("z = " + z);
  
  // Finally, create a final variable, w, that is the result of subtracting z from 13, adding the result to y, and dividing by x, then squaring the whole thing.
  
  
  // println("w = " + w);
