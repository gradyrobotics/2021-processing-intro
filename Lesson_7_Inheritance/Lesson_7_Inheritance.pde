// Inheritance
// Classes and inheritance are a tricky topic to master and fully understand, so don't be discouraged if this doesn't immediately make sense.

// Before starting with the instructions down below, read the information on the below links first
// These are introductions to interfaces and inheritance, two important techniques for connecting multiple classes.
// Again, these are complex topics. Please, reread anything you need to and don't be afraid to ask for clarification!
// You are not expected to understand this right away

// https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html
// https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/subclasses.html

// Looking on the left side of this website, you will see lots more in depth information.
// If you want to get a deeper understanding, please read through these articles and try out some of the concepts!

void setup() {
  // Task 1
  // Currently, the Shape interface is empty, add a method header to it that requires a show method
  // Will the show method need any parameters?
  
  // Task 2
  // Fill out the Rectangle class so that it has the following things:
    // Instance variables for the x coordinate, y coordinate, width, and height
    // A constructor that takes in the appropriate parameters and sets the corresponding instance variables
    // Change the class header to implement the Shape interface
    // Change the class to actually implement the Shape interface.
    
  // Task 3
  // Fill out the Square class so that it has the following things:
    // Change the class header to both inherit from the Rectangle class AND implement the Shape interface
    // A constructor that takes in the appropriate parameters and sets the corresponding instance variables
    // Hint: the square constructor does not need as many parameters as the rectangle, but should still initialize the same 4 instance variables
    
  // Task 4
  // Create Rectangle and Square objects and ensure they work properly
