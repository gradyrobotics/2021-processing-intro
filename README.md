Training for new members using processing.  

To use this tutorial, you must first have git and processing installed. Follow these links to install them:
* https://git-scm.com
* https://processing.org/download/

Now that you have those installed, open up the command line on your computer. If you are using a Windows machine, this is called powershell. On Mac or Linux, this is called the terminal.  
Use the following commands to figure out where you are, navigate to your documents directory, create a directory called `G3-2021` and go into that directory:
* `pwd` means print working directory. This will print the path to what folder you are in.
* `ls` stands for list. This will list all the files and subdirectories in the current directory
* `cd` stands for change directory. Use this command to navigate into a subdirectory.
* `mkdir` means make directory. Once you are in your documents directory, use this command to make the new `G3-2021` directory.

If you have not used the terminal before, this can be very confusing. Please do not hesitate to ask for help or clarification.  

Now that you are in the `G3-2021` directory, run the following command to clone this git repository onto your computer:
`git clone https://github.com/gradyrobotics/2021-processing-intro.git`
If this command does not work properly, ask for assistance.  

Now that you have all of the lesson files on your computer, open Processing. Navigate to File > Open, then find the `G3-2021` directory containing the lessons and open `Lesson_1_Main_Loop_Control/Lesson_1_Main_Loop_Control.pde`. This wil open up the lesson 1 files in your Processing window. Once everyone has this open, your veteran instructor will tell you what to do.
